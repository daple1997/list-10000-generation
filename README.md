# list-10000-generation
This JavaScript code generates a list of random numbers from 1 to 10000.
A set is used to avoid repeating number generations and to minimize lookup speed.
A random number is generated from 1 to 10000 but is not added if already present in the set.
If it hasn't been added yet then the number goes in the list and is added to the set.
